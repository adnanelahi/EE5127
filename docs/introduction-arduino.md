# What is Arduino ?

# What is a Computer ?
A computer is an electronic device that is capable of receiving, storing, processing and outputting data. It is designed to perform various tasks and can be programmed to carry out specific instructions. The basic components of a computer include a central processing unit (CPU), memory, storage devices, input devices, output devices, and communication interfaces. The CPU is the brain of the computer and controls all the other components. The memory is used to temporarily store data and instructions that are being processed by the CPU. The storage devices are used to store data and programs permanently. The input devices are used to enter data and instructions into the computer, while the output devices are used to display or output the results of the processing. Communication interfaces enable the computer to connect with other devices and networks. Computers come in many different sizes and forms, ranging from large desktop computers to small handheld devices such as smartphones and tablets.
